# Reconstructability Analysis of Prime Number System Dynamics

This repository contains some code and data used for a draft paper called "Reducing Uncertainty in Consecutive Prime Residue Classes with Reconstructability Analysis" which used the [Occam](http://dmit.sysc.pdx.edu/) software package to perform reconstructability analysis on consecutive prime residue classes as a take on tha 2016 paper [Unexpected biases in the distribution of consecutive primes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03720) by Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan.

## Using Git LFS for prime number data

The prime number data is stored using [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git LFS). This means that the data is not stored in the Git repository itself, but rather in a separate location. This is because the data files are too large to be stored in the Git repository. To use Git LFS, you need to install the Git LFS client on your computer. See the [Git LFS documentation](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for more information.
